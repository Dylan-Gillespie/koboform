The KoBo Project data collection methodology uses hardware and software technologies to enable researchers (and others) collecting, collating, and presenting information. The basic principles are ease of use, flexibility, and openness to development.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The KoBo project assists researchers in collecting secure and accurate data in challenging environments

==Data Collection==

We provide several tools for data collection. 

===KoBoCollect===

Built on the Open Data Kit, KoBo allows users to administer surveys using Android devices. 
Digital Data Collection is faster and more accurate than paper-based surveys. 

===KoBoSync===

The KoBoSync Post Processor is a Java application that will allow users of _Kobo Collect_ to synchronize surveys from Android devices onto a desktop computer. The Post Processor will also aggregate all data from all surveys and transcribe the data into a Comma Separated Value _(CSV)_ storage file. This is like a flat database file that can be imported into any kind of storage or analysis software. We use Statistical Package for Social Science _(SPSS)_ for analysis, and MySQL for storage, but you can import a _CSV_ into almost anything. 

===KoBoForms ===

===In Open Public Testing===

The Forms Builder is a browser based tool for creating surveys with a simple interface for non-programmers. Researchers who can't program in XML can use this tool to build a survey from a list of questions. The end result is a survey which can be run with _KoBo Collect_.
